## Installation
First install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Then install Package Control to download the following packages.

## Packages
Here is a list of useful packages you may want to install:

- A File Icon (add file icons in side bar)

## Preferences
Feel free to check my personal preferences and customize them as you wish.

## Key bindings
These are some key bindings I added to my configuration:

<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> : open cmd

<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> : open bash

<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd> : open git bash

<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> : run current program (Python or C)

## Build systems
I created build systems for Python, C, C++ and R.

You can add them in `Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`.

To use them, go to Tools &rarr; Build System and select one.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> or <kbd>f7</kbd> to execute it.
